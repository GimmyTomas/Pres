# Description
This is a repository containing the code used in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15110">arXiv:2507.15110</a> [1] to study gravitational atoms in binary systems. The code is public in order for other people to use it, check it and improve it.

(i) The file `horizon-fluxes.cpp` calculates the cloud mass loss rate and the resonance power ("P_res"). Compiling instructions are inside the file. The content of the main function should be self-explanatory.

(ii) The folder `100_Mc_break` contains a script, `100_Mc_break.py`, used to determine the bound on the cloud's mass due to the resonance with |100>. This script makes use of the other files in the folder.

(iii) The folder `Pres-results` contains some of the data shown in Figures 1, 2, and 4 of [1].
